# IrcColors

Makes username colors in chat unique, like in IRC clients

<!-- ![Chat with IrcColors and Compact++ enabled]() -->

Improves chat readability by assigning every user an unique nickname color,
making distinguishing between different users easier. Inspired by the feature
in many IRC clients, such as HexChat or WeeChat.

Keep in mind this overrides role colors in chat, so if you wish to know
someone's role color without checking their profile, enable the role dot feature
in accessibility settings.

Created for use with the [Compact++](https://gitlab.com/Grzesiek11/compactplusplus-discord-theme)
theme.
