# Vencord

The cutest Discord client mod

## Features

-   Super easy to install (Download Installer, open, click install button, done)
-   100+ plugins built in: [See a list](https://gist.github.com/Vendicated/8696cde7b92548064a3ae92ead84d033)
    -   Some highlights: SpotifyControls, Experiments, NoTrack, MessageLogger, QuickReply, Free Emotes/Stickers, CustomCommands, ShowHiddenChannels, PronounDB
-   Fairly lightweight despite the many inbuilt plugins
-   Excellent Browser Support: Run Vencord in your Browser via extension or UserScript
-   Works on any Discord branch: Stable, Canary or PTB all work (though for the best experience I recommend stable!)
-   Custom CSS and Themes: Inbuilt css editor with support to import any css files (including BetterDiscord themes)
-   Privacy friendly, blocks Discord analytics & crash reporting out of the box and has no telemetry
-   Maintained very actively, broken plugins are usually fixed within 12 hours
